# Installing Api
*This only works for linux. For Windows a similar .bat script would have to be made*

all you need to do is execute `./clean_install.sh` from the root directory.

# Starting Api
```sh
cd api
npm start
```
test the api is working by going into `localhost:8080/swagger` in chrome and doing stuff.
